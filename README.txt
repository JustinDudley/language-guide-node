This is app 1 of 3, as part of my annual SMART goals.

It is based on the Jonas Schmedtmann Udemy class on Node and MongoDB.
For that class I created a project called jonas-udemy-1-node-farm-starter,
which is in my gitHub repo.
This project is modeled closely on that one.

I will use typescript in this app
