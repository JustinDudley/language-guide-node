                It took me about one year to learn enough to get hired. I started with a bunch
                of random python tutorials, then did a 6-month part-time online bootcamp
                learning python and java, all while still working another full-time job.
                Finally I bit the bullet and did a 3-month in-person bootcamp, learning C#,
                javascript, and Angular.
            </p>
            <span>My advice:</span>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    You can start with zero-depth-entry tutorials like codacademy which
                    spoon-feed you coding syntax without your having to install anything on
                    your laptop.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Pretty soon you'll want to learn how to code on your own, and you'll begin
                    to learn how to set up your own machine to do that.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Especially at the beginning, always use tutorials that are recent. Anything
                    more than a year old is bound to have information that is out of date.
                    There are work-arounds for those situations, but when you are starting out,
                    it is very difficult to problem-solve those. Don't be afraid to spend $18
                    on a tutorial.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Free stuff is great, especially at the very beginning, but don't be afraid
                    to drop $18 on a course here and there. When you pay money, you are more
                    likly to get material that is (1) high-quality and (2) up-to-date.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>
