                So you want to choose a programming language...
            </div>
            <p class="explanation">
                So many choices! How to pick? As a bootcamp graduate, now in my
                third year in the industry, I have learned a few languages and
                made a few mistakes. This guide is designed for people who are
                coming to programming from a different job or career, and do not
                necessarily have the support, guidance, and structure of a
                university program. It is meant for people who are looking to be
                full-time software developers, not so much for those already in
                a science-heavy industry who want to make themselves more
                valuable by picking up a language to help with their current
                position.
            </p>
            <p class="explanation">
                There are many languages, but to pick a first language, there
                are really only, in my opinion, three, maybe four good options.
                This is a good thing! Your job at the beginning is simple.
            </p>
            <ul class="explanation">
                Here are some things this site WON'T tell you:
                <li>
                    Salaries associated with a language. Junior developers make
                    a similar salary regardless of language. After you've spent
                    a few years in the industry, you'll be able to target
                    certain positions, salary ranges, and languages.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Percentages of software developers using a given language.
                    This information can be useful, but it is also misleading to
                    junior developers, since certain languages like Swift are
                    used primarily by senior devs. (Skew effect)
                </li>
                <li>
                    25 fascinating programming languages, none of which are a
                    common entry point into the industry.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="explanation">
                Also, I should note that any language you choose will lead you
                in a good direction. All languages share certain features, such
                as functions and fdjfkdj and fjdkjf, and once you are proficient
                in one, it is not difficult to learn another. It is not uncommon
                to try a couple languages in the first year and flail around a
                bit. Try to settle into one language as soon as you can and get
                good at it. -- Also, I should include a section that gives tips
                on HOW to learn: Try codeacademy first because it is a
                zero-entry environment. Then quickly switch to a tutorial that
                requires you to install some things and work in your own
                environment. Always use a tutorial that is recent (less than a
                year old), since anything older will have pieces that you have
                to problem-solve, and that may be beyond your capability at the
                beginning. Don't be afraid to spend $18 on a tutorial. Free
                stuff is great, but a money-course has a better chance of being
                up-to-date and really high-quality. (My current favorit is
                Udemy, but you will find your own path). I COULD tell them MY
                path: Online tutorials, a 6-month part-time online bootcamp
                while I was still in my former career, then a full-on 3-month
                bootcamp, then a LOT of learning on-the-job after I landed my
                first job. --a lot of this information should probably be on a
                separate page. It's different from the other stuff. I need to
                stay focused.
            </p>
            <p class="explanation">
                Finally, learning a computer language throughly takes many
                years. You don't need to learn everything at once. If you enjoy
                programming, and enjoy the industry, you will have a long time
                to get better and better.
