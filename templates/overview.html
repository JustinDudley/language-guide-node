                So you want to choose a programming language...
            </div>
            <p class="explanation">
                So many choices! How to pick? As a third year software
                developer, I have learned a few languages and have made some
                mistakes, and worked in the industry. This guide is designed for
                people who are coming to programming from a different job or
                career, and do not necessarily have the support, guidance, and
                structure of a university program. This guide does not tell you
                which languages will earn you the most money, because they will
                all earn you enough in the beginning, and you can make choices
                about earning power after you've been in the industry for a
                couple years. There are many languages, but to pick a first
                language, there are really only, in my opinion, three, maybe
                four good options. This is a good thing! Your job at the
                beginning is simple.
            </p>
            <p class="explanation">
                Also, I should note that any language you choose will lead you
                in a good direction. All languages share certain features, such
                as functions and fdjfkdj and fjdkjf, and once you are proficient
                in one, it is not difficult to learn another.
            </p>
            <p class="explanation">
                Finally, learning a computer language throughly takes many
                years. You don't need to learn everything at once. If you enjoy
                programming, and enjoy the industry, you will have a long time
                to get better and better.
