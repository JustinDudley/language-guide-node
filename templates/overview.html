            <div class="header">So you want to choose a programming language...</div>
            <p>
                So many choices! How to pick? As a bootcamp graduate, now in my third year in
                the industry, I have learned a few languages and made a few mistakes. This
                guide is for people who are exploring a new career in software development, but
                don't have the support, guidance, and structure of a university program. It is
                not really aimed at people who are already in a data-heavy industry and are
                looking to pick up a programming language to aid their current work, but those
                people can read it too!
            </p>
            <p>
                The number of languages out there is large, but picking a first language is
                easier than it might seem. There are only three, maybe four, good options for a
                beginning programmer. This is a good thing!
            </p>
            <span>Here are some things this guide WON'T tell you:</span>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Salaries associated with each language. Junior developers will probably
                    make a similar salary regardless of language. After you've spent a few
                    years in the industry, you'll be able to target certain positions, salary
                    ranges, and languages.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Percentages of software developers using each language. This information
                    can be useful, but it is also misleading to junior developers, since many
                    specialty languages are primarily going to be used by devs with a few years
                    of experience.
                </li>
                <li>
                    25 fascinating programming languages: They're all wonderful, but most of
                    them are not a viable entry point into the industry.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Please note that any language you choose can lead you in a good direction. All
                languages share certain features (defining variables and functions, using
                operators, setting up logic flow...), and once you are proficient in one, it is
                not difficult to learn another. It is not uncommon to try a couple languages in
                the first year and flail around a bit. Try to settle into one language as soon
                as you can and get good at it. As you go, you will also gain experience with
                certain tooling necessities such as code editors, git and github, and command
                line interfaces.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span
                    >The different pathways available for learning your chosen language can be
                    overwhelming.</span
                >

                </a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, learning a computer language thoroughly takes many years. You don't
                need to know everything at once. If you enjoy programming, and enjoy the
                industry, you will have a long time to get better and better.
